# Netbeast Dashboard
### Connect everything. Regardless its brand or technology,

One API, unlimited products and hacks. Netbeast middleware translates messages from different IoT protocols and device interfaces so they work as one. Have no more "hubs". Work across **devices** not _brands_.

```
var netbeast = require('netbeast')
netbeast.find().then(function () {
  netbeast('lights').set({ power: 1 }) // will turn on all lights in your home
})
```

# Installation
<a name="installation-basic"></a>
## Basic
Make sure you have installed [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).
```bash
npm install -g netbeast-cli
netbeast start
```

Find it live at http://localhost:8000 or run it as `netbeast start --port <PORT>`

**Pro tip.** To get started developing you will find handy to have it installed in a folder of
your choice.
```
git clone https://github.com/netbeast/dashboard
cd dashboard
npm install --production
npm start
```

<a name="installation-board"></a>
## Raspberry / Beagle Bone / Pine64 or your choice of board
Make sure again you have installed [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/). It can be tricky depending on your OS & architecture. If any doubts please reach [forum](http://bit.ly/23UyVMR) or open an [issue](https://github.com/netbeast/dashboard/issues).
1. Apply the basic installation from above, preferably using git.
```
git clone https://github.com/netbeast/dashboard . # clone in this folder
npm i --production # no front-end or test dependencies
```
1. Keep it running 24h 7 days a week, to use it as Smart Home Hub. You can use utilities such as [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) or [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2).
```
npm i -g pm2
sudo pm2 start index.js --port 80
```
3. [Soon] Learn how to attach a DHCP name to your Netbeast as https://home.netbeast and how to deal with wireless configuration in Linux from our [blog](https://blog.netbeast.co).

<a name="installation-docker"></a>
## Using docker :whale:
Make sure you already have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) installed.

1. Download the netbeast image from dockerhub
```
docker pull netbeast/netbeast
```
2. Run it
```
docker run -p 49160:8000 -d netbeast/netbeast
```
This will run your docker container on the port 49160

3. You can now play on it. Access to your docker `CONTAINER_IP`.
> http://CONTAINER_IP:49160

# Overview
#### Find inspiration, think about new projects, connect your new hardware.
Netbeast apps are HTML5 user interfaces that enable controlling IoT or visualizing their data. Netbeast plugins are apps that translate from the Netbeast IoT Unified Scheme, to each particular implementation of an IoT device.

**Explore existing apps and plugins of our [public registry](https://dashboard.netbeast.co/explore).**

## Control devices regardless of their brand and technology
Take a look on our unified API on action in this demo on youtube, under a Netbeast app that creates new scenes.

## Measure all your data
Use the [Netbeast API](https://github.com/netbeast/api) along with the dashboard to publish data through MQTT or reuse it in your apps. [Read more](http://docs.netbeast.co/chapters/api_reference/index.html
).

## Write IoT apps without spending on hardware or suffering expensive deployments
Take advance of Netbeast IoT middleware to test your apps with software that mocks the hardware interface.

Find tutorials in the [docs](http://bit.ly/1VYfqDH), read a blog post about it on [TopTal](https://www.toptal.com/nodejs/programming-visually-with-node-red) or join the [forum](http://bit.ly/23UyVMR) to ask how to do it.

<a name="documentation"></a>
## Documentation
We publish a [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/netbeast/docs/details) with fresh documentation on [https://docs.netbeast.co](http://bit.ly/1VYfqDH). If you want to open an issue, contribute or edit it, find your way on its github repo https://github.com/netbeast/docs.

Here you have the [Netbeast Cheat Sheet](http://forum.netbeast.co/uploads/default/original/1X/1560f93d99752ab7c23aa72ea1bc942e487f93a4.jpg). It can be really useful to find quick references.

<a name="iot-with-node"></a>
# Create IoT with Node.js
In Netbeast we care about education, openness and interoperability. We have created a series of workshops to teach developers to better use HTTP, MQTT in combination with the **Dashboard** to create data bindings and incredible apps. Use your favorite boards and platforms as Arduino, Pi Zero, Pine64, Belkin Wemo, Homekit and a infinite list, connected.

<a name="apps"></a>
## Apps
A Netbeast app allows you to run the Dashboard unique API in the browser or backend equally. Just expose some user interface in your apps root. In the following snippet we serve in the root all files inside `public` folder.

```
var express = require('express')
var app = express()

// Netbeast apps need to accept the port to be launched by parameters
var argv = require('minimist')(process.argv.slice(2))

app.use(express.static('public'))

var server = app.listen(argv.port || 31416, function () {
  var host = server.address().address
  var port = server.address().port
  console.log('Example app listening at http://%s:%s', host, port)
})
```

<a name="connect-devices"></a>
## Connect Devices
> A plugin is an app that enables your Dashboard to communicate with a different protocol or proprietary device.
> It's like if you, that want to learn Chinese, could speak Chinese by installing an app.
> Luis, cofounder of Netbeast

A basic plugin must implement at least a `discovery` primitive to declare itself on Netbeast's database.
Fill the gaps to create your first hardware integration into Netbeast:
```
var netbeast = require('netbeast')
var express = require('express')
var cmd = require('commander') // reads --port from command line

// Netbeast tells you in which port to run your Plugin endpoint
cmd.option('-p, --port <n>', 'Port to start the HTTP server', parseInt)
.parse(process.argv)

var app = express()

/*
* Discover your resources / scan the network
* And declare your routes into the API
*/

app.get('/discover', function () {
	/* TODO, implement discovery */

	/* for each device */
	netbeast('topic').create({ app: 'my-first-plugin', hook: 'DEVICE_ID' })
	/* end of for */

	/* or */
	/* Register all device together and delete the resources no longer available */
	netbeast('topic').udateDB({ app: 'my-first-plugin', hook: ['DEVICE1_ID', 'DEVICE2_ID', 'DEVICE3_ID', 'DEVICE4_ID'] })
})

/*
* Create here your API routes
* app.get(...), app.post(...), app.put(...), app.delete(...)
*/

app.get('/:device_id', function (req, res) {
	// id of the device the dashboard wants
	// << req.params.device_id >>
	// dashboard will do GET on this route when
	// netbeast('topic').get({})

	/* TODO: Return device values from req.query */

	// res.json({ YOUR_PLUGIN_DATA })
})

app.post('/:device_id', function (req, res) {
	// id of the device the dashboard wants
	// << req.params.device_id >>
	// dashboard will do POST on this route when
	// netbeast('topic').set({})

	/* TODO: Change device values from req.body */

	// res.json({ YOUR_PLUGIN_DATA })
})


var server = app.listen(cmd.port || 4000, function () {
  console.log('Netbeast plugin started on %s:%s',
  server.address().address,
  server.address().port)
})
```

Learn how to launch it, debug it and publish it on the [documentation](https://docs.netbeast.co/chapters/developing/plugins/write_your_first_plugin.html).
